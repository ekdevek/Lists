Heya.

So uhh, what exactly is this?


As the repo's title implies, this is a list. The very first of many (well, second if you count README.md).

Enough fluff, this is probably what you're here for.

Project Ideas:
- Forking, because I have no original ideas
- Starting some apps for *nix/terminals (will have a list of their own)
- More lists
- Starting my own kernel development because I'm an operating system nut
- Maybe a small game or two
- Documentation for hardware projects
- an ABOUTME.md? haha\

I haven't used github for very long, but this is where I'm going to close my document. See ya!
